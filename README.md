Wifi Range. 
There are N rooms in a straight line in Geekland State University's hostel, you are given a binary string S of length N where S[i] = '1' represents that there is a wifi in ith room or S[i] = '0' represents no wifi. Each wifi has range X i.e. if there is a wifi in ith room then its range will go upto X more rooms on its left as well as right. You have to find whether students in all rooms can use wifi.
